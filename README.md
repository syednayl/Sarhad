This was a project carried out over my third semester at Habib University, for the Object Oriented Programming course offered in Fall 2018.
It's a platform based shooter game, implemented using C++ and an external library called "SDL" which stands for Simple Directmedia Layer,
which is a 2D Cross-Platform Graphics Library.
